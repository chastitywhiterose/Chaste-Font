# Chaste-Font
Chastity's font library used in Chaste Tris and Chaste Puyo

When my made my two games Chaste Tris and Chaste Puyo, I did not want to use any of Raylib's built in font features. I wanted something blocky and retro. Therefore I made my own bitmap font files and code to read and use them that ONLY my programs understand.

I created this side project entirely devoted to my font library as a complete afterthought because I wanted to add some features and the code was mixed into my games but wasn't yet a project by itself. Now it is and I hope my code is useful to other people who can understand it. I am also very willing to answer questions people may have about it.
