I am starting a new project. I will call it "Chaste Font". It will be my own custom font library.
It will be based on 8x8 size pixel fonts which can be scaled.

This is important because I want the perfect font for my Chaste Tris game and it needs to look blocky and pixelated just like the old video games.

At least that is what it was going to be. This is old code which uses only the standard library and some basic functions. Eventually I may do more with it but I moved on to create font libraries for Raylib and SDL. I am keeping this code for later use though.

Through some testing, I have discovered that these 95 characters are always printable regardless of font or operating system.

 !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
 
 Therefore they form the basis of my entire font library used for Chaste Tris and other things.
